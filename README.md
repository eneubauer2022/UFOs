# UFOs

## Overview
- After creating a webpage for our client, Dana, that filtered UFO sightings based on date - she asked if we could improve upon the page by adding multiple filters. She would like to include city, state, country, and shape to filter by more column heads and provide a better analysis. 

## Resources
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Results
- The user can use the filters below to filter the data. They can use any or all the filters (date, city, state, state, country, and shape) to find the results they are looking for.

## Summary
- One drawback from the data is that the sightings are only from the year 2010. If we could add more data from more recent years, that would provide a more robust data set and more accurate results.

- Also the search criteria needs to be entered in as lower case search options. It is not grammatically correct to have city names, states and countries in lower case and not visually pleasing. We could write code in Javascript that the user could enter the city, state or country with a lower case or uppercase letter and it would still provide results. 

- We should also add more images to the webpage so it is more visually pleasing.
